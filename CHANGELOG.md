# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-07

Interactive TUI + CLI improvements.

### Added

- Interactive TUI (`opencodex tui`) with 7 screens: Dashboard, Providers, Models, Mappings, Codex, Logs, Settings
- Provider management: add/edit/delete/test connections, auto-fetch models
- Model browser: toggle ON/OFF, expand/collapse provider groups, search
- Model mapping editor: map Codex model names to provider targets
- Codex integration screen: backup/restore config, restart app, update model catalog
- Real-time log viewer for proxy diagnostics
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S (start), Ctrl+E (stop), F5 (refresh), Esc (back)
- `opencodex tui` CLI command as alias for TUI launch
- Optional `tui` extra dependency (`textual>=0.40`)

### Fixed

- Reference catalog `contrib/opencodex-catalog.json` now ships with the `ModelsCache` wrapper
  (`fetched_at`/`etag`/`client_version`/`models`). Codex 0.142+ desktop app requires all four
  top-level fields — the previous bare `{"models": [...]}` caused the model picker to fall back
  to "Custom" instead of showing the full list. The CLI tolerated the bare format, so this only
  surfaced in the desktop app.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-21

Bug fixes + removed AUR packaging.

### Fixed

- `call_upstream_chat` now catches `json.JSONDecodeError` — invalid JSON from upstream returns 502 instead of crashing
- Streaming crash: if `handle_streaming_request` raised after SSE headers sent, sends `response.error` SSE event instead of corrupted HTTP response
- Streaming + missing API key: `resolve_api_key` moved before `response.created` so error event reaches client
- README launchd path: `~/Library/.codex/logs` → `~/.codex/logs` (matches plist)
- LICENSE copyright year 2025 → 2026

### Removed

- AUR package (`aur/opencodex-proxy-git/`) — not launching on AUR
- PyPI — not launching on PyPI; `uvx --from git+...` is the install path

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-21

Graceful shutdown + launchd service file.

### Added

- SIGTERM handler for graceful shutdown on `launchctl bootout` / `systemctl stop`
- launchd plist at `contrib/launchd/com.opencodex.proxy.plist`
- README: launchd setup instructions with copy + bootstrap commands

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-21

Initial public release.

### Added

- Responses `input` to chat `messages` translation
- `instructions` and `developer` roles mapped to system messages
- Function tool schema passthrough
- Custom/freeform tool adaptation (Codex `apply_patch` works)
- `reasoning_content` replay across tool-call turns
- Real-time SSE streaming
- Image captioning via MiMo V2.5 when tools are present
- SSRF protection on image URLs (`data:image/` and `https://` only)
- Configurable body cap, bind address guard
- macOS keychain credential resolution
- Local health and model-list endpoints
- Reference model catalog with all 13 OpenCodeX models
- systemd user service at `contrib/systemd/`
- 41 tests (unit + integration) covering protocol, credentials, HTTP round-trip, alias map, tool calls, streaming tool calls, streaming error handling, streaming crash recovery, invalid upstream JSON, SSRF, and image captioning

### Security

- SSRF validation on image URLs
- Non-negative Content-Length validation
- Generic error messages to client (full bodies only in trace logs)
- No path reflection in 404 responses
- Bind address guard warns on non-localhost
